## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The **EV Charger Location Tracker Tool** is a full-stack web application designed to accurately capture the physical location of EV chargers.  
This ensures that field teams and future fleet operations have precise geolocation data, improving operational efficiency.

## ðŸ›  My Role & Contributions

I was responsible for building the application **end-to-end**, working closely with senior developers for technical guidance.  
Key features I implemented include:

- **Secure user sessions**: Unique one-time links sent via email with prefilled charger details.
- **Interactive map selection**: Choose current GPS location or search for a specific location.
- **Accuracy enforcement**: Selected location must be within 100 meters of the actual charger.
- **Time-limited access**: Sessions expire after 1 hour to prevent unauthorized use.
- **Clean, responsive UI** built with React + Tailwind CSS.
- **RESTful APIs & session logic** developed using Flask.
- **Geolocation & search integration** via Google Maps API.

## âœ… Result

The proof of concept was approved by the product team and became the foundation for further internal EV infrastructure tools.  
This project strengthened my expertise in:

- Full-stack development (React, Tailwind, Flask)
- Geolocation-based applications
- Cross-functional team collaboration
- End-to-end product delivery
